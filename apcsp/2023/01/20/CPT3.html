<p>I will need clear and concise responses that answer what is being asked of, no need for anything extra.
Clear answers that are detailed and specific to what is being asked.
Have a list that serves a clear  more than just holding data.
Be able to explain algorithms inside your code without needing to talk about other parts that don’t affect that algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="summary">
<a class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>In these submissions, the submission usually fails by not properly explaining the purpose of a list, algorithm, or program function and purpose. Defining a program’s funciton is not the same as defining the program’s purpose. There also must be an understanding of code so that they can be split up to fill in the part of the response that needs code. If you understand the code, them the code present in the response should earn you the points.</p>
