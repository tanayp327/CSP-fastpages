    <h2 id="purpose-and-function">Purpose and Function</h2>
<p>The purpose of my CPT project is to allow users to easily look for recipes from our entire database so that they find the perfect one for them</p>

<p>The function is that the users will be able to use a search bar to type in a certain recipe that they want, and they will see the most relevant results based on the keywords for each recipe.
 </p>
<h2 id="data-abstraction">Data Abstraction</h2>
<p>When the JSON data for all the saved recipes is parsed, then a list called relevantRecipes, will record all of the relevant recipes based on the keywords of the recipe. This will appear on a table on the website after the user searches for their recipe.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="managing-complexity">Managing Complexity</h2>
<p>Using keywords for each recipe and storing the results in a list based on the keywords, allows for a simple way to display results of the search.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="procedural-abstraction">Procedural Abstraction</h2>
<p>First, the user will enter an input in the search bar and this will send a request to the server, then, a procedure called recipeSearch() will search through the recipes in the database and all the keywords of the recipe to display relevant results. Furthermore, a function called sortingRecipes() will order the recipes from most to least relevant. Finally, the procuedure will also delete the list after exiting the search feature.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="algorithm-implementation">Algorithm Implementation</h2>
<p>Sequencing will be used to order the results of the inputs from the relevance by using predefined keywords for each recipe.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>My first test will be to check if the procedure correctly places the relevant recipes in the list</li>
  <li>Test if a new list is created for new searches and this is deleted when the user exits the search, or the the website altogether</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="code-plan">Code Plan</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The user visits the website and opens the search feature, displaying a search bar and enters their input</li>
  <li>The function recipeSearch() will search through the different keywords of the recipes</li>
  <li>The function sortingRecipes() will order the recipes and add to a list</li>
  <li>After sequencing the recipes, they show in table form</li>
  <li>They scroll through the options to select the one they want</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="video-plan">Video Plan</h2>
<p>In the video I will search for a certain food, for example “pancakes”. I will scroll through the results to demonstrate how the sequencing by keywords works.</p>
