<p>There were 2 instance in which my score was different from the score that College Board gave. The mistakes were in the managing complexity and testing of submission 4. I thought the submission described how the list managed complexity and that it contributed to the program. College Board thought that the student did not explain how the list managed complexity. The response refers to the list wordList, which is not identified.</p>

<p>I should make sure that everything is submitted in the right places and easy to understand.
Make sure the function AND purpose are described.
Make sure to describe how everything impacts the overall function/purpose.</p>
