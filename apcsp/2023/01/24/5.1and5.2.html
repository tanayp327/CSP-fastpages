<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Engineers take advantage of computing innovations to collect data and design products.</li>
  <li>Communication has greatly improved as a result of computing, which highly increases the efficiency of many fields.</li>
  <li>Storage of data and documents has become much easier due to the invention of new devices and computers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Harmful Effects</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a loss of privacy due to the use of information gathered by companies</li>
  <li>Many skillful craftsman have been replaced by machines, and lose their jobs</li>
  <li>Many people become too absorbed in technology and face health problems</li>
</ul>

Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</h4>
<p>Dopamine issues are very real; many people become so absorbed in video games and social media that they can only focus on these things. These people often see low grades as well as little social interactions.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-someone-empower-themself-in-a-digital-world">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-does-someone-empower-themself-in-a-digital-world" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?</h4>
<p>Empowering yourself in a digital world can mean learning effective ways to use technology as well as knowing how to protect yourself and your information. Building these good habits allows you to properly find valid information on the internet as well as see different perspectives.</p>

Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.</h4>
<p>You can provide people with the information needed to stay safe while on the internet as well as providing them ways to effeciently use their devices. For example, at DNHS we have this class which helps people be digitally empowered.</p>

<p>One barrier at Del Norte is a financial barrier. Many people aren’t able to be empowered because they lack access to proper technology. This is common in many parts of the world as people don’t have access to devices and other forms of technology.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The main pro of internet blockers is that they help students stay on task at school</li>
  <li>Some websites and resources that the school blocks are bad, and are often necessary for some classes</li>
