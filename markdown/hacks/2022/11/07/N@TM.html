<p>I think N@TM was a very fun experience were I could show off my project and look at all the different classes’ artwork as well.</p>

<p>There is a lot going on in this image and I think it looks good. Its a very creative idea and well executed.</p>

<p>The detail on the octopus is quite impressive and it looks pretty realistic as well.</p>

<p>I love the color on this and the reference to One Piece and the fact it is somewhat accurate to the anime.</p>

<p>I think this is a really nice image and the hand in this image is quite impressive, especially because drawing hands tends to be very difficult.</p>
