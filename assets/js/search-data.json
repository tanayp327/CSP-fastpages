It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

In symmetric encryption, only one secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt encrypted content. In asymmetric encryption public and private keys are used in order to encrypt and decrypt. | Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.

In Mr Mortensen’s most recent years in industry, there were many Lawyers making a profession on Patents and how they can be impacted on General Public Licensing (GPL). . Qualcomm makes its money on patents, if you use GPL software you could be voiding your rights to charge for software and patents. Open Source by nature, specifically GPL, says any derivative work is free and code should be shared. Qualcomm wants all derivative work to require a royalty payment payment, also anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty. . From synopsis.com, “Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers.” Qualcomm has had 20 technical jobs and 3 lawyers analyzing all the code produced, analyzing code for Open Source inclusion, and analyzing impact of such licenses to its ability to charge royalties for the use of their Patents. . This may sound like a simple problem, but think about the Students of Today, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet. Well, don’t think the Workers of Today are entirely different. In summary, it is important to know the type of software license you are copying, it could impact billions of dollars in business. . License Communities, License Types Guide . Adding and selecting a license GitHub instructions. An author, a licensor, needs to determine a license. This may result in asking… Do I want to waive default copyright in reuse? | Do I want to allow derivative works or not? | Do I want to require all derivative code to be shared? | | . Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal . The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you’ve created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain. . Open Source MIT License . This license in friendly to someone like Qualcomm! This allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions. Typically, the author of software with MIT License want credit. Credit could be as simple as adding the authors name in comments. . Close source means the GitHub project could be private. . Open Source GPL License . The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. . Open source means the GitHub project must be public. . For a company like Qualcomm, they are required to institute many practices to deliver their code in parts (public vs private). Isolating their patent and secret code, far away from the GPL or Creative Commons code. In fact, a company that is protecting their patents may need to division engineers, split distribution, not deploy to public, etc. After distribution, the customer of the Patented (ie Qualcomm) product is required to put the public/private domain code back together again. . Legal and Ethically . We need to comply with the terms of licenses. We need to cite sources. (I am particularly bad with internet pictures. However, in the picture of the Black Duck above I am actually advertising the Company). . As consumers, we have become aware that Music and Movie companies own content. These companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content. Most of us buy subscriptions to services. However, some figure out ways to bypass systems and allow download. Often we will see these sites disappear, as they are illegal. . In software, it can be more complicated to understand all the Creative Commons licenses and its impact to our own ideas and businesses. Mostly, if we use things in class, there is “no problem” with Open Source as our usage is considered educational use. Creative Commons software has enabled amazing innovation as we are able to do so much for free, as we have done in this class. However, Individuals and Companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license. . Long ago, I remember being amazed that Red Hat was not selling its Linux distribution, they were giving away the software. They had to! This was in the terms of the licenses they were using, GPL. However, as an early pioneers in Linux distributions, they established a business model around buying their support agreement. They rose in fortune, became a public company, and had an amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO). Many, many vendors have followed the Red Hat model in building free distributions and establishing unique business models. Qualcomm figured out how to mix Patent and GPL businesses and have flourished since abandoning all proprietary, to include Android in its very complicated business model using Android. . Creative Commons, Open Source are free terminologies! However, businesses will not last without income. And today, businesses won’t last without engineers pulling Open Source software. . Blog Post Reflection . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. MIT License: | . Very simple, open-source | Allows users to use, modify, and distribute one’s project as long as they credit them | Not much protection | Possible that the user misuses the project - GPL License: | Strong protection of the rights of users | Promotes collaboration and sharing | The lisence may not be followed simply because users don’t know what they have to do | . | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.

This can be used to prevent pirating different types of content. | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. Frontend and Backend: We chose a GPL License for both our frontend and backend so that users are forced to keep their repository public so it is clear that we are being credited | Personal: I chose to use an MIT license for my personal FastPages because it allows a lot of leniency for users in the use of my FastPages, which I am open to letting people use how they want. | . |",

Such conversation often lead to conversations on computer bias, particularly when bias creates a harmful effect. . As programmers, you now have the possibility of creating algorithms. It has been said, “Humans are error-prone and biased”. So, does that mean algorithms and the computers they run on are better? . Intentional or Purposeful bias (Crossover Group Up, 10 minutes) . Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? 41.7% of Facebook’s audience are 18-34 years old. The data also says that 62% of TikTok’s users are 10-29 years old. There isn’t purposeful exclusion on these platforms, but the different types of content appeals to different people. I don’t think it is harmful because everyone is free to sign up for whichever platform they want. | Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? Virtual assistants have female voices because females are commonly perceived as more freindly and helpful. I personally dont think this is harmful, but some children may beleive that this means that females are just assistants. | Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) The YouTube algorithm uses my previously watched videos as well as data from other websites to influence what I watch and might cause me to spend more time on YouTube. | . As Pairs (5 minutes) . Watch the video… HP computers are racist | Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas… Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? Based on the owner’s joking tone in the video, he probably understands that it likely wasn’t intentional, but he understandably upset by the flaw. | If yes or no, justify your conclusion. His tone in the video wasn’t as serious as someone that thought HP was being intentionally racist. | How do you think this happened? I think this happened because they didn’t test their software on anyone with dark colored skin, so they didn’t know that the software didnt work as intended. | Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? This can be potentially harmful because of the fact that people with dark skin are excluded, although it wasn’t intended to be harmful. | Should it be corrected? Yes, it should definitely be corrected. Everyone should be able to have equal opportunity wiht technology no matter of their race. | What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? Make sure that all different groups of people are involved in the testing process. | . | . Hacks . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. We learned about computing bias, which is when computer systems unfairly discriminate against certain types of people. I think that seeing what happened with the person with an HP computer shows that a lack of testing can be very detrimental. I think that for what we’re doing right now, computer bias isn’t very likely to happen, but we should keep in mind that there are different types of people that we need to consider when testing. .",

            "content": "Purpose and Function . The purpose of my CPT project is to allow users to easily look for recipes from our entire database so that they find the perfect one for them . The function is that the users will be able to use a search bar to type in a certain recipe that they want, and they will see the most relevant results based on the keywords for each recipe.   . Data Abstraction . When the JSON data for all the saved recipes is parsed, then a list called relevantRecipes, will record all of the relevant recipes based on the keywords of the recipe. This will appear on a table on the website after the user searches for their recipe. .   . Managing Complexity . Using keywords for each recipe and storing the results in a list based on the keywords, allows for a simple way to display results of the search. .   . Procedural Abstraction . First, the user will enter an input in the search bar and this will send a request to the server, then, a procedure called recipeSearch() will search through the recipes in the database and all the keywords of the recipe to display relevant results. Furthermore, a function called sortingRecipes() will order the recipes from most to least relevant. Finally, the procuedure will also delete the list after exiting the search feature. .   . Algorithm Implementation . Sequencing will be used to order the results of the inputs from the relevance by using predefined keywords for each recipe. .   . Testing . My first test will be to check if the procedure correctly places the relevant recipes in the list | Test if a new list is created for new searches and this is deleted when the user exits the search, or the the website altogether |   . Code Plan . The user visits the website and opens the search feature, displaying a search bar and enters their input | The function recipeSearch() will search through the different keywords of the recipes | The function sortingRecipes() will order the recipes and add to a list | After sequencing the recipes, they show in table form | They scroll through the options to select the one they want |   . Video Plan . In the video I will search for a certain food, for example “pancakes”. I will scroll through the results to demonstrate how the sequencing by keywords works. .",

            "content": "Score . . Corrections . Question 9 The correct answer is B, not C because you need to progress in position each team you check for the value of an element in the list. . Question 12 The correct answer is B, not A because AND means that both have to be true, and it is impossible to be on floor 1 and 2 at the same time. . Question 15 The correct answer is D because once the robot reaches the top middle square, it will rotate right and move forward, placing it in the top right corner instead of top left. . Question 17 Instead of selecting B, I should have selected D, because it should be in one if else statement instead of having 2 if statements. . Question 28 I forgot to select 2 answers, I should have also selected option C, it effectively does the same thing. . Question 30 I selected option A, which is incorrect because it is impossible to draw a circle when the radius is 0. . Question 41 Option B is incorrect as Random could be either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If it is either 1 or 2, the value of sum is increased by 1, which is like a person voting. This does not match the goal of the program, which is to simulate an election in which a certain candidate is expected to receive 20 percent of the vote. . Question 43 Option A is wrong, because the main use of simulations are to simulate possibilities on how things could happen before they actually happen. . Question 45 If the problem can be solved in a certain time frame, then there is no reason to use a heuristic approach. . Question 47 Calculating can be done exactly and precisely, so there is no reason to use an approximation, like when used to find the shortest driving route. . Reflection . I feel like I made a lot of preventable mistakes, and I might have rushed a little bit on some of the questions. If I took the time to read the questions thoroughly, and not make silly mistakes like not selecting multiple options. .",

Engineers take advantage of computing innovations to collect data and design products. | Communication has greatly improved as a result of computing, which highly increases the efficiency of many fields. | Storage of data and documents has become much easier due to the invention of new devices and computers | . Harmful Effects . There is a loss of privacy due to the use of information gathered by companies | Many skillful craftsman have been replaced by machines, and lose their jobs | Many people become too absorbed in technology and face health problems | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Dopamine issues are very real; many people become so absorbed in video games and social media that they can only focus on these things. These people often see low grades as well as little social interactions. . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Empowering yourself in a digital world can mean learning effective ways to use technology as well as knowing how to protect yourself and your information. Building these good habits allows you to properly find valid information on the internet as well as see different perspectives. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . You can provide people with the information needed to stay safe while on the internet as well as providing them ways to effeciently use their devices. For example, at DNHS we have this class which helps people be digitally empowered. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . One barrier at Del Norte is a financial barrier. Many people aren’t able to be empowered because they lack access to proper technology. This is common in many parts of the world as people don’t have access to devices and other forms of technology. . Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on Unit 5.1 . People are easily able to find recipes that cater to their specific dietary needs | People will be able to find the recipes that they want as well as being able to see other people’s opininons with minimal searching of the internet | People will be able to have recipes that they already have tried and liked readily available to them whenever they want | . Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. . People can somehow bypass the sanitation process of the data and post foul language, as well as post recipes that don’ turn out well. | . What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . The main pro of internet blockers is that they help students stay on task at school | Some websites and resources that the school blocks are bad, and are often necessary for some classes | . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? . Since we are in a rich and privileged community, many people don’t understand the issues that other people face, both in other parts of the country and the world. | .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure).

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem quickly and with a minimum amount of resources, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the time complexity of the algorithm. | Another way is through space complexity. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: .

We just have to make sure that we don&#39;t repeat any cities. . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) .

The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is &quot;halts&quot;. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of &quot;never&quot;. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | .

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It is too cold outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It is too cold outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example in Class . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): print(&quot;the number is even&quot;) else: print(&quot;the number is odd&quot;) # Run this cell to see how it works . choose value for x the number is even .

Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . choose value for x 1.0 . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(varx) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . choose value for x 12 6.0 3.0 10.0 5.0 16.0 8.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . for variable in iterable: statement() . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. | . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # using a for loop for i in list: #for item in the list, print the item print(i) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Iteration using the amount of items in the list for i in range(lengthList): print(list[i]) . list = [&quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Juliett&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;] # Once again, taking the length of the list lengthList = len(list) # Setting the variable we are going to use as 0 i=0 # Iteration using the while loop # Argument saying WHILE a certain variable is a certain condition, the code should run while i &lt; lengthList: print(list[i]) i += 1 . Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta Echo Foxtrot Golf Hotel India Juliett Kilo Lima Mike November Oscar Papa Quebec Romeo Sierra Tango Uniform Victor Whiskey X-ray Yankee Zulu . Using the range() function . But wait, there&#39;s more . Need to save even more time? The above is useful for many occasions, but can get tedious fast, in this case, use range() | . x = range(5) for n in x: print(n) . 0 1 2 3 4 . Else, elif, and break . For when 1 statement isn&#39;t enough . Else:when the condition does not meet, do statement()- Elif: when the condition does not meet, but meets another condition, do statement() | Break: stop the loop | . HW Iteration . Use the list below to turn the first letter of any word (using input()) into its respective NATO phonetic alphabet word . Ex: . list -&gt; . lima india sierra tango . words = [&quot;alfa&quot;, &quot;bravo&quot;, &quot;charlie&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;foxtrot&quot;, &quot;golf&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;india&quot;, &quot;juliett&quot;, &quot;kilo&quot;, &quot;lima&quot;, &quot;mike&quot;, &quot;november&quot;, &quot;oscar&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;quebec&quot;, &quot;romeo&quot;, &quot;sierra&quot;, &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;uniform&quot;, &quot;victor&quot;, &quot;whiskey&quot;, &quot;xray&quot;, &quot;yankee&quot;, &quot;zulu&quot;] inp = input().lower() for i in range(len(inp)): for j in range(len(words)): if inp[i] == words[j][0]: print(words[j]) . hotel echo lima lima oscar . 2D Iteration . 2D Arrays . A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() . Raw matrix (list of lists): [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&#39; &#39;, 0, &#39; &#39;]] Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . def print_matrix2(matrix): for row in matrix: # Iterates through each &quot;row&quot; of matrix. Row is a dummy variable, it could technically be anything. It iterates through each value of matrix and each value is it&#39;s own list. in this syntax the list is stored in &quot;row&quot;. for col in row: # Iterates through each value in row. Again col, column, is a dummy variable. Each value in row is stored in col. print(col, end=&quot; &quot;) # Same as 1 print() # Same as 1 print_matrix2(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . More Functions . Try to find another way to print the matrix. Only complete one of the two (unless you&#39;d like to do both). Below is a hint . fruit = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;] print(fruit) print(*fruit) # Python built in function: &quot;*&quot;. Figure out what it does . apples bananas grapes . def print_matrix3(matrix): code = &quot;your code goes here&quot; . Alternatively, find a way to print the matrix using the iter() function you already learned. Or use both! . def print_matrix3(matrix): for i in range(len(keypad)): print(*keypad[i]) print_matrix3(keypad) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 . keyboard = [[&quot;`&quot;, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;], [&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, &quot;&#39;&quot;], [&quot;Z&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;]] . Print what month you were born and how old you are by iterating through the keyboard (don&#39;t just write a string). . print(keyboard[2][6], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[1][6], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[2][8], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[1][5], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[3][7], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[0][1], end=&quot;&quot;) print(keyboard[0][5], end=&quot;&quot;) . JULY,15 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . 1 6 R A H C M . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. .",
