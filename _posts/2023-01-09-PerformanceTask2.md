## Submission 1

| Category     | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
|--------- | ----------- | --------- | 
| Program Function and Purpose | 0 | 0 | The submission showed example of function, but not anything related to purpose. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | There were examples of lists, but it doesn't affect the program or purpose. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | There was no real explanation on managing complexity. |  
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | There was no real explanation on procedural abstraction. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | No example was shown again. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Good explanation and example on testing. |

## Submission 2

| Category     | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
|--------- | ----------- | --------- | 
| Program Function and Purpose | 1 | 1 | Demonstrated clear understanding of both purpose and function. | 
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | 2 code segments that demonstrate lists and variables. Accurate and concise use and description. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Included both a code segment and explanation on managing complexity. |  
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Explains parameters and procedure in detail. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Procedure includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes 2 calls to the procedure and the conditions being tested, as well as the results of each call. |

## Submission 3

| Category     | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
|--------- | ----------- | --------- | 
| Program Function and Purpose | 0 | 0 | Program function was not included in this response. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Written response shows 2 code segments about data storage and explains what is being stored. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Shows use of lists to manage the complexity of the program. |   
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Although fairly simple, explains the parameters and procedures well. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Includes examples of sequencing, selection, and iteration and explains well. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Shows the 2 calls and the results, meeting all requirememts.  |

## Submission 4

| Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
|--------- | ----------- | --------- | 
| Program Function and Purpose | 1 | 1 | Program function and purpose are both explained sufficiently. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | 2 segments were shown for the code but didn't display real understanding of the lists. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | I thought the student used the lists well to manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Describes how the procedure is useful, and describes the parameters. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Includes examples of sequencing, selection, and iteration and explains well. |
| Testing | 1 | 0 | The submission showed the calls, which I thought deserved points. |

## Reflection 
There were 2 instance in which my score was different from the score that College Board gave. The mistakes were in the managing complexity and testing of submission 4. I thought the submission described how the list managed complexity and that it contributed to the program. College Board thought that the student did not explain how the list managed complexity. The response refers to the list wordList, which is not identified. 

## What to Keep in Mind
I should make sure that everything is submitted in the right places and easy to understand.
Make sure the function AND purpose are described.
Make sure to describe how everything impacts the overall function/purpose.
