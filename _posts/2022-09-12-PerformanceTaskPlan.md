## Program Purpose and Function

- I am planning to make a quiz about Biology. It will be able to determine how well you might do in Biology.
- Simply recieve an input from the user and output whether it was correct
- There will be an easy mode and a hard mode

## Data Abstraction

- Store questions and correct answers in a dictionary
- Depending on the difficulty mode different questions will be displayed

## Managing Complexity

- To manage the complexity, there will simply be a single dictionary for each difficulty mode
- Loop it to display 5 questions for each mode depending on what is selected

## Procedural Abstraction

- First prompt user to start and select difficulty mode
- Loop through dictionary to display questions on User's screen

## Algorithm Implementation

- Looping the code to display the different questions

## Testing

- Try many different methods of writing
- Peer edit from different people
