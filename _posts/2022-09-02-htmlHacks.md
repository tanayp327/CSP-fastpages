## Changing Theme of Blog

I temporarily changed my theme of my blog to the Time Machine theme.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/fastpages-themechange.jpg)

The preview image didn't show up and the formatting was messed up.



## Time Box Table

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
     <th>Week</th>
     <th>Sprint</th>
     <th>Overview</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>
            2
        </td>
        <td>
            <a href="/APCSP/week/2">Data Abstraction</a>
        </td>
        <td>
        We did slightly more python, involving lists and dictionaries, we made another quiz with those, and learned HTML fragments.

    </tr>

    <tr>
