# Q21

# Q30

# Q41
C is correct because using this procedure would allow the student to identify the location where a negative value occurs, and then change that value to 0. This process can continue with repeated calls to the procedure until there are no more negative values.

# Q47
B is correct because the binary search algorithm starts at the middle of the list and repeatedly eliminates half the elements until the desired value is found or all the elements have been eliminated. For a list with 10,000 elements, the list will be cut in half a maximum of 13 times, with the total of 14 elements needing to be examined. The list will start with 10,000 elements, then will be reduced to 5,000 elements, then to 2,500 elements, then to 1,250 elements, then to 625 elements, then to 312 elements, then to 156 elements, then to 78 elements, then to 39 elements, then to 19 elements, then to 9 elements, then to 4 elements, then to 2 elements, and then, finally, to 1 element. Of the given values, 15 is closest to 14.
