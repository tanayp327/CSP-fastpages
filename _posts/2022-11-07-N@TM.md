# Night at the Museum

I think N@TM was a very fun experience were I could show off my project and look at all the different classes' artwork as well.

# Artwork
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Teeth.jpg)

There is a lot going on in this image and I think it looks good. Its a very creative idea and well executed.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Octopus.jpg)

The detail on the octopus is quite impressive and it looks pretty realistic as well.

I love the color on this and the reference to One Piece and the fact it is somewhat accurate to the anime.

I think this is a really nice image and the hand in this image is quite impressive, especially because drawing hands tends to be very difficult.
