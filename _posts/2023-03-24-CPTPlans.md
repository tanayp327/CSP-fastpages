description: What I need to do to complete my CPT
---

I need to personalize my flask so that the CPT doesn't get flagged for plagarism, I have already stripped the frontend of what is unnecessary so that it doesn't match what my teammates would submit. Our group's idea was to have a recipe website with features based around dietary restrictions, search, reviews, and favoriting. Since I am doing favoriting as my feature, which highly depends on the search feature, I need to change the code for the search (while using inspiration from Yuri) so that it looks different. I also need to get my written response ready to submit
