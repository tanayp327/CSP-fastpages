## Table for Submission 1

| Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | My Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response showed and explained how the program functions and also describes the purpose without restating the function. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The second program does not use the list in the first code segment. This makes the list not relevant to the program’s purpose. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The list is irrelevant to the code provided. The code does use the list in other parts of the code but not in the code shown in the part that was submitted.|
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The purpose of the code shown is not mentioned.|
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response sufficiently explains to the reader how the program works, including the use of sequencing, selection, and iteration.|
| Testing | 1 | 1 | There are two calls through different code segments result in proper outputs and there is a proper explanation. |

## Table for Submission 2

| Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | My Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose and function were both stated and the program’s functionality was shown in the video. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The code displays a list and properly explains how the list contributes to the rest of the program.|
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The list is used to manage what letters are in the unknown word. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response properly explains the purpose of the code.|
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response explains the purpose of the code and explains the use of sequencing, selection, and iteration. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The two different calls went through different code segments that result in the proper outputs. The submission has a good explanation. |

## Table for Submission 3

| Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | My Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Both the purpose and function were explained.|
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The list that was supposed to have been used isn't presusedent in the first piece of code. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 |There isn't a proper explanation on how the list manages the complexity.|
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The function in the code segment isn't called in the second piece of code. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The explanation never says what causes the program to do something other than that is using if statements. |
| Testing | 0 | 0 | The two tests are done in two different procedures and only call another procedure and don’t have set parameters.|

## Table for Submission 4

| Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | My Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose was stated along with a brief summary of the function. The response also tells the reader how to play. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The code shows a list and how it works and its inclusion to the rest of the program. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because it explains how the list is needed in order to display the final scores. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The two pieces of code meet what is required and it is explained that the purpose of this part of the code is to make the game more challenging. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The response tells the reader how the program runs and what code allows it to work. It also talks about use of sequencing, selection, and iterion from the use of if-else statements and loops. |
| Testing | 0 | 0 | The testing calls do not have stated parameters because the calls are just lines from the code and not actual values. |

## Reflection
I will need clear and concise responses that answer what is being asked of, no need for anything extra.
Clear answers that are detailed and specific to what is being asked.
Have a list that serves a clear  more than just holding data.
Be able to explain algorithms inside your code without needing to talk about other parts that don’t affect that algorithm.

## Summary
In these submissions, the submission usually fails by not properly explaining the purpose of a list, algorithm, or program function and purpose. Defining a program's funciton is not the same as defining the program's purpose. There also must be an understanding of code so that they can be split up to fill in the part of the response that needs code. If you understand the code, them the code present in the response should earn you the points.
