### Corrections
**Question 9**
The correct answer is B, not C because you need to progress in position each team you check for the value of an element in the list.

**Question 12**
The correct answer is B, not A because AND means that both have to be true, and it is impossible to be on floor 1 and 2 at the same time.

**Question 15**
The correct answer is D because once the robot reaches the top middle square, it will rotate right and move forward, placing it in the top right corner instead of top left.

**Question 17**
Instead of selecting B, I should have selected D, because it should be in one if else statement instead of having 2 if statements.

**Question 28**
I forgot to select 2 answers, I should have also selected option C, it effectively does the same thing.

**Question 30**
I selected option A, which is incorrect because it is impossible to draw a circle when the radius is 0.

**Question 41**
Option B is incorrect as Random could be either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If it is either 1 or 2, the value of sum is increased by 1, which is like a person voting. This does not match the goal of the program, which is to simulate an election in which a certain candidate is expected to receive 20 percent of the vote.

**Question 43**
Option A is wrong, because the main use of simulations are to simulate possibilities on how things could happen before they actually happen.

**Question 45**
If the problem can be solved in a certain time frame, then there is no reason to use a heuristic approach.

**Question 47**
Calculating can be done exactly and precisely, so there is no reason to use an approximation, like when used to find the shortest driving route.

### Reflection
I feel like I made a lot of preventable mistakes, and I might have rushed a little bit on some of the questions. If I took the time to read the questions thoroughly, and not make silly mistakes like not selecting multiple options.
