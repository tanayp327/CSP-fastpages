<p>The more you crowdsource, the more you reach beyond your own community, the more likely you will reduce Computer Bias.  Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">Wikipedia definition on crowdsourcing</a>.  It can have inaccuracies, but when it does it often is corrected through a self-policing community.  Reviews and many authors have made this, according to many, better than “official” information.</li>
  <li>Crypto currency and associated block chain.  All exchanges of money are validated at least 3-times by independent miners.  If there is a flaw in the independent calculations the process is checked and performed again.  Innovation of crypto crowdsourcing has impact on how governments think about currency.   Additionally, block chain algorithms are being considered for many other crowdsourcing most private data (ie medical records).</li>
  <li>COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing.   This data has impacted all our lives and decision we make on attending public events, flying on planes, or wearing masks.  The community of data and analysts will spawn many new ways of thinking about data that impacts lives.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI.  This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used</li>
  <li>Currently for our CPT project we are using an API called Recipe by API-Ninjas. Last trimester we used a world clock API.</li>
  <li>We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub.  Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students.  Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history.  What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?</li>
  <li>The biggest discovery that I have made on GitHub is that you are able to see the traffic to your repo and see it down to the day.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle datasets</a> for code and science exploration.  The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels.  Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions.  Exam top 10 to 20.  Did you see anything interesting?</li>
  <li>I found it interesting that there were 2 datasets specific to Brazil in the top 10 of the most votes.</li>
  <li>Kentucky Derby Winners is the dataset with the most votes</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in your project …</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CompSci has 150 ish principles students.  Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?</li>
    <li>Crowdsourcing is already in place in the CSP environment, with the use of Slack to ask questions, get opinions, and get the reactions of different people through the emoji feature in Slack.</li>
    <li>What about Del Norte crowdsourcing?  Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?</li>
    <li>Instead of using Slack, or similar platforms, it might be more beneficial to use social media platforms, as that is the easiest way to reach high school students, who tend to use social media the most. Perhaps the best platform is Instagram because it is easy to use polls.</li>
    <li>What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting?  Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.</li>
    <li>At N@TM we can note what different people who come by look at on our website, such as what they search for and what recipes they favorite. It would also be easy to see what the people filter out in their recipes.</li>
  </ul>
