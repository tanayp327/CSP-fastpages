<h3 id="how-a-computer-works">How a Computer Works</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>As we have learned, a computer needs aa program to do something smart.  The sequence of a program initiates a series of actions with the computers Central Processing Unit (CPU). This component is essentially a binary machine focussing on program instructions provided.  The CPU retrieives and stores the data it acts upon in Random Access Memory (RAM). Between the CPU, RAM, and Storage Devices a computer can work with many programs and large amounts of data.</p>

  <li>Essential Knowledge
    <ul>
      <li>A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.</li>
      <li>A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.</li>
      <li>A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.</li>
      <li>A computer network is a type of computing system.</li>
      <li>A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a receiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver.</li>
      <li>Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver.</li>
      <li>The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.</li>
      <li>Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second</li>

  <li>Essential Knowledge
    <ul>
      <li>The internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprierary) communication protocols.</li>
      <li>Access to the internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an internet connected device.</li>
      <li>A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.</li>
      <li>The protocols used in the internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the internet.</li>
      <li>Routing on the internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance</li>
      <li>The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands.</li>
      <li>The internet was designed to be scalable</li>
      <li>Information is passed through the internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets.</li>
      <li>Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the internet, as well as for data reassembly.</li>
      <li>Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all</li>
      <li>IP, TCP and UDP are common protocols used on the internet.</li>
      <li>The world wide web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files.</li>
      <li>HTTP is a protocol used by the world wide web</li>
      <li>The world wide web uses the internet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Go over AP videos, vocabulary, and essential knowledge.  Draw a diagram showing the internet and its many levels. A preferred diagram would using your knowledge of frontend, backend, deployment, etc.  Picture would highligh vocabulary by illustration. The below illustration have some ideas</li>

  <li>Often we draw pictures of machines communicating over the Internet with arrows.  However, the real communication goes through protocol layers and the machine and then is trasported of the network.

<p>The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for <strong><em>communication between web browsers and web servers</em></strong>. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts.  The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller <strong><em>chunks called “segments”</em></strong>. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection.</p>

<p>The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then <strong><em>encapsulating the data into IP packets</em></strong>. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network.</p>

<p>The “network” layer is responsible for <strong><em>routing data packets between networks</em></strong> using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and <strong><em>network congestion</em></strong> control.</p>
